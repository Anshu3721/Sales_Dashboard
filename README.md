# Sales Dashboard in Power BI

This repository contains a Sales Dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance and profitability for our organization. It offers interactive visualizations and analytics that allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Features

The Sales Dashboard includes the following key features:

**Sum of Sales by Categories:** The dashboard provides a clear breakdown of sales figures across various product categories. This visual representation has allowed us to identify the most lucrative categories, enabling us to focus our efforts and resources effectively.


**Sum of Sales and Profit by Month:** Tracking sales and profit trends on a monthly basis has been an eye-opener for us. With this insightful visualization, we've been able to recognize seasonal patterns, make informed decisions, and take advantage of peak sales periods.


**Sales Distribution of Products by Category (Yearly):** One of the highlights of this dashboard is its ability to display the sales distribution of our products across categories on a yearly basis. This has empowered us to identify product category shifts over time, aiding us in strategic planning for the future.

**Top 5 Customers:** Identifying and valuing our top customers is essential. The dashboard highlights our most valuable customers, facilitating targeted customer relationship management.

**Sum of Profit by Year and Categories:** Profitability analysis is essential for sustainable growth. This aspect of the dashboard allows us to compare profits over different years and across product categories, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to maximize our overall profitability.
